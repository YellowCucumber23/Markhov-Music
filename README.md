# Markhov-Music
This application takes in a midi file and parses it to create sheet music with the a similar note distribution

Code in ./src was written by me and everything else is the LilyPond Module used to compile the music into a readable pdf file

Here is an example output or open music.pdf in ./src for the full sheet music:
